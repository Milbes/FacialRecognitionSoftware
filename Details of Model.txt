Programming Language : Python
Python Version: 3.6.8 x64bit
Web Framework: Django 

Models:
1) Face Detection : MTCNN Model
2) Face Recognition : Inception Resnet Model

Image Reading Module: Pillow and OpenCV

AI Model Framework: PyTorch(CPU version)

Model Working Brief:
1) Web App allows user to Upload their Photo.
2) Then selected image is passed inside Face Detection Model(MTCNN) to detect faces.
3) If multiple faces are found then biggest face is selected automatically.
4) Then detected face ROI ( Region of Interest ) is aligned correctly if face is tilted in any direction.
5) Then the Face Recognition Model reads all Known Faces Images one by one.
6) Then aligned Unknown Face is passed into Face Recognition Model to match with Known Faces.
7) When face matches with any face then it Gives the access.
8) Else Access is Denied.
